# Wine Classification Project

## This repository contains code for classifying wines as "good" (rating > 5) or "bad" (rating <= 5) based on chemical compositions. The dataset is from Kaggle and includes red and white wines.

### Objective

Build a model to predict wine quality accurately.

### Dataset

Chemical attributes and quality ratings for wines.

### Contents

data/: Contains winequality-red.csv and winequality-white.csv

notebooks/: Predict Wine Quality Final.ipynb for data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.

### Usage

Clone: git clone https://github.com/akshayut1998/Wine-Classification-Project.git

### Explore notebooks for code. Run code, experiment, and modify.
